A little challenge with my solution in python ;) 


## DESCRIPTION

Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order in between trees and without moving the trees.

### Example
```
For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
sortWithTrees(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180].
```

### Input/Output

  * [execution time limit] 4 seconds (python3)

  * [input] array.integer a

```If a[i] = -1, then the ith position is occupied by a tree. Otherwise a[i] is the height of a person standing in the ith position.

 Guaranteed constraints:
5 ≤ a.length ≤ 15,
-1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 200.
```

  * [output] array.integer

```Sorted array between each trees a with all the trees untouched.```
